<li>Tasked to work on the problem of visual speech recognition as a member of a three-man group.</li>
<li>I focused on improving viseme recognition by utilizing generative adversarial networks as a tool for data augmentation.</li>
<li>Utilized VGG-16 convolutional neural network for classification. Achieved a maximum increase in viseme recognition accuracy of 3.695\% over a baseline accuracy by using images generated by the PGGAN for data augmentation.</li>
<li>As a part of the project, performed data pre-processing, and implemented evaluation metrics.</li>
<li>Presented the paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9293784">Improved Viseme Recognition using Generative Adversarial Networks</a> at IEEE Tencon 2020.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/Viseme_GAN.pdf">[pdf]</a></li>
<li>Code written exclusively in Python. Notable libraries used were Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV.</li>
