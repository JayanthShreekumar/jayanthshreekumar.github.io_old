<ul>
<li>Built four different image colorization models using ResNet, U-Net, and Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch.</li>
<li>Implemented a data loader with appropriate transforms, and an inference script to test on grayscale images.</li>
<li>Output images of both UNet implementations are crisper, indication that skip connections are useful.</li>
</ul>
