<ul>
<li>Worked on quantum key distribution - a secure communication protocol for information reconciliation between two users.</li>
<li>Utilized LDPC codes to perform efficient decoding of information. Used Slepian Wolf coding and multi-layer coding scheme to perform layer-wise decoding for increased performance.</li>
<li>Implemented simulated annealing to find the optimal set of parameters.</li>
<li>Modelled the quantum key distribution channel using probability, linear algebra, and machine learning as a mixture of two Gaussians and a uniform distribution.</li>
<li>Wrote bash scripts to run simulations on the UCLA Hoffman supercomputer.</li>
